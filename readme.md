Workspace: Collecting workspace informationFiltering to most relevant information# VNC Client for ESP32-S3 with Touch Display

This project implements a VNC (Virtual Network Computing) client on an ESP32-S3 device with a touch screen display. It allows you to view and interact with a remote computer's desktop through the VNC protocol.

## Overview

The ESP32-S3 connects to your WiFi network and establishes a connection to a VNC server. The screen displays the remote desktop, and the touch functionality allows you to interact with the remote system.

## Hardware Requirements

- ESP32-S3 development board (e.g., ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1)
- Compatible touch display (supports various displays through Arduino GFX Library)
- USB cable for programming and power

## Software Requirements

- [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) with VS Code extension
- Arduino framework for ESP32

```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/VNC-Client-for-maTouch.git
cd VNC-Client-for-maTouch
```

### 2. Install PlatformIO

Install the PlatformIO extension in Visual Studio Code.

### 3. Configure the project

Edit the following files to match your setup:

#### Main Configuration (platformio.ini):

Make sure your platformio.ini has the correct settings for your ESP32-S3 board.

### 4. Install UI Library

The UI library is included in the repository. You need to manually copy the ui folder to the esp32-s3-devkitc-1 directory after the first build:

1. First, build the project once to create the necessary directories
2. Then copy the UI library:
```bash
cp -r ui .pio/libdeps/esp32-s3-devkitc-1/
```

### 5. Configure WiFi and VNC settings

Edit the wifi and VNC connection settings in the main.cpp file:

```cpp
// WiFi credentials
#define SSID_NAME "your_wifi_ssid"
#define SSID_PASSWORD "your_wifi_password"

// VNC server details
#define VNC_IP "192.168.1.100"
#define VNC_PORT 5900
#define VNC_PASSWORD "your_vnc_password"
```

### 6. Configure display settings

The project is designed to work with various displays. Edit the display configuration in main.cpp to match your specific display:

Look for the display initialization section and uncomment/modify as needed for your specific display model.

### 7. Build and upload

Use PlatformIO to build and upload the project to your ESP32-S3:

```bash
pio run -t upload
```

## Usage

1. Power on your ESP32-S3 device
2. The device will connect to the configured WiFi network
3. Once connected, it will attempt to connect to the VNC server
4. If successful, the remote desktop will appear on the screen
5. Use the touch screen to interact with the remote desktop

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

If the device cannot connect to WiFi or the VNC server:
- Check your WiFi credentials
- Ensure the VNC server is running and accessible
- Verify the VNC server IP address and port are correct
- Make sure your VNC server allows the connection (check firewall settings)

### Display Issues

If the display doesn't work properly:
- Verify your display model is properly configured
- Check the physical connections between the ESP32-S3 and the display
- Try different display initialization parameters

### Touch Issues

If touch doesn't work properly:
- Check the touch controller configuration in touch.h
- Verify the physical connections to the touch controller
- Calibrate the touch controller if necessary

   - Allow you to interact with the remote desktop through the touch screen

2. The display will show connection status:
   - "Init WiFi" during WiFi connection
   - Connection error messages if any issues occur
   - The remote desktop once connected

## Touch Functionality

The touch screen allows you to:
- Move the cursor on the remote desktop
- Click by tapping the screen
- Perform other mouse operations based on the configured touch gestures

## Troubleshooting

### WiFi Connection Issues
- Make sure your WiFi credentials are correct
- Ensure the ESP32-S3 is within range of your WiFi network

### VNC Connection Issues
- Verify your VNC server is running
- Check the IP address and port number
- Ensure the VNC password is correct
- Check if the VNC server allows connections from new clients

### Display Issues
- Check the physical connections between the ESP32-S3 and the display
- Verify that the correct display driver is being used in the code

## Dependencies

This project uses the following libraries:
- Arduino GFX Library
- TFT_eSPI
- arduinoVNC
- WiFi library for ESP32
- Touch controller libraries (e.g., TAMC_GT911)

GitHub Copilot: # **VNC Client for ESP32-S3 with Touch Display**

This project implements a **VNC (Virtual Network Computing) client** on an **ESP32-S3** device with a **touch screen display**. It allows you to **view and interact** with a remote computer's desktop through the **VNC protocol**.

---

## 📌 **Hardware Requirements**

- **ESP32-S3 Development Board** (e.g., ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1)
- **Compatible Touch Display**
- **USB Cable** for programming

---

## 🛠 **Software Requirements**

- [**PlatformIO**](https://platformio.org/) with **VS Code** extension
- **Arduino framework** for ESP32  

---

## 🚀 **Setup Instructions**

### **1️⃣ Install PlatformIO**

Install the **PlatformIO** extension in **Visual Studio Code** if you haven't already.

```bash
code --install-extension platformio.platformio-ide
```

### **2️⃣ Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/VNC-Client-for-maTouch.git
cd VNC-Client-for-maTouch
```

### **3️⃣ Install the UI Library**

The UI library is included in the repository. After the first build, manually copy the UI library to the .pio directory:

```bash
# First, build the project once to create the directories
pio run

# Then copy the UI library
cp -r ui .pio/libdeps/esp32-s3-devkitc-1/
```

> **Note**: The .pio directory is usually not pushed to repositories, so the UI library is included separately.

### **4️⃣ Configure WiFi and VNC Settings**

Edit the main.cpp file to set your WiFi and VNC server details:

```cpp
// WiFi credentials
#define SSID_NAME "your_wifi_ssid"
#define SSID_PASSWORD "your_wifi_password"

// VNC server details
#define VNC_IP "192.168.1.100"
#define VNC_PORT 5900
#define VNC_PASSWORD "your_vnc_password"
```

### **5️⃣ Build and Upload**

Connect your ESP32-S3 board via USB and upload the firmware:

```bash
pio run -t upload
```

---

## 📟 **Usage**

After uploading the firmware, the ESP32-S3 will:
1. Connect to the configured WiFi network
2. Attempt to connect to the VNC server
3. Display the remote desktop on the screen
4. Allow interaction via the touch screen

The display will show connection status:
- "Init WiFi" → During WiFi connection
- Error messages → If any issues occur
- Remote desktop → Once connected

## ✨ **Touch Functionality**

The touch screen allows you to:

✔️ Move the cursor on the remote desktop  
✔️ Click by tapping the screen  
✔️ Perform other mouse operations based on touch gestures  

---

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

### WiFi Connection Issues

✔️ Ensure your WiFi credentials are correct  
✔️ Make sure your ESP32-S3 is within range of the network  

### VNC Connection Issues

✔️ Verify your VNC server is running  
✔️ Check the IP address and port number  
✔️ Ensure the VNC password is correct  
✔️ Make sure the VNC server allows new client connections  

### Display Issues

✔️ Check the physical connections between ESP32-S3 and display  
✔️ Verify that the correct display driver is being used in the code
